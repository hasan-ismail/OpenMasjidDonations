# OpenMasjid Donations — multi-stage, multi-arch (amd64 + arm64).
# The JS build stages run on the native BUILD platform (fast, arch-independent
# output); only the runtime stage runs as the TARGET arch, where `npm ci` pulls
# the correct prebuilt native binaries (e.g. better-sqlite3) for that architecture.

# ---- Build the web app (donor site + admin) → static files -----------------
FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM node:22-slim AS web
WORKDIR /web
COPY web/package.json web/package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY web/ ./
RUN npm run build

# ---- cloudflared (for the optional Cloudflare Tunnel public-access feature) -
# Taken from the official multi-arch image, pinned by version. No --platform
# override, so it's pulled for the TARGET arch (arm64 build → arm64 binary).
