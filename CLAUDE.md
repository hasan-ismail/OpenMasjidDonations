# CLAUDE.md — OpenMasjidDonations

> This file is the single source of truth for the **OpenMasjidDonations** app. Read it fully before writing any code. When in doubt, follow this document, then the two references in §2, over your own assumptions. If something is ambiguous, ask before guessing.

---

## 1. What we are building (one paragraph)

**OpenMasjidDonations** is an app for [OpenMasjidOS](https://github.com/OpenMasjid-Solutions/OpenMasjidOS) that gives a masjid a beautiful, self-hosted **donation website** powered by **Stripe**. A donor opens the page (on the masjid's network via a kiosk/QR code, or publicly if the masjid chooses to expose it), picks a cause, chooses a **preset or custom amount** (one-time or monthly), and pays by card. An admin manages everything from a polished, login-protected panel: create multiple **donation pages/appeals**, write rich content, upload images, set preset amounts, theme the site, enter Stripe keys, and review donations. On startup the app **receives the masjid's details** (name, address, contact, currency) from the platform and is configured for Stripe. It runs as **one Docker container**, is **AGPL-3.0**, and looks and feels like the rest of the OpenMasjid family.

---

## 2. Prime directives — read the references first

You are building an OpenMasjidOS app. Two repositories define how that is done. **Read them before and during the build; mirror them.**

1. **`OpenMasjid-Solutions/OpenMasjidDisplay`** — the reference implementation and your structural template. It is a completed, shipped OpenMasjidOS app. **Copy its shape**: the `server/` + `web/` split, the one-container `Dockerfile`, the `docker-compose.yml` conventions, the `manifest.yaml`, the `icon.svg`/`screenshots/` layout, the platform **single-sign-on + theme/wallpaper matching done server-to-server** (never trusting the browser, with a local-password fallback), the least-privilege posture, and the CI that builds and publishes the image. When this CLAUDE.md and Display's real files disagree on a mechanism, **read Display's actual code and follow it.**

2. **`OpenMasjid-Solutions/OpenMasjidAPPS`** — the catalog contract. Read **`OpenMasjidOS/docs/APP_MANIFEST_SPEC.md`** for the manifest, the `docker-compose.yml` rules (labels, project naming, volumes, ports, restart policy, banned settings), and validation. The app is registered by adding an entry to **`registry.yaml`** in OpenMasjidAPPS: `id`, `repo`, `ref` (a git tag). **Do not** hand-build a `catalog.json` — the registry model supersedes the older folder/catalog model in places; follow what Display does.

**Hard rules that override everything except safety:**
- **License: AGPL-3.0.** Add the full AGPL-3.0 `LICENSE`. Include a visible "Source code" link to this repo in the admin UI.
- **Never copy code from umbrelOS / `umbrel-apps` (PolyForm-Noncommercial)** — incompatible with AGPL. Reimplement from behaviour.
- **Stripe secret keys are server-side only.** They must never reach the browser, never be logged, never be committed. The browser only ever sees the **publishable** key.
- **Never touch raw card data.** Card entry happens inside Stripe's own elements/hosted pages (PCI scope SAQ-A). We only handle tokens/IDs.

---

## 3. Repository & identity

- This is its **own repository** named **`OpenMasjidDonations`** (separate from the platform and the catalog).
- App **`id`: `donations`** (kebab-case, used in the manifest, compose labels, and the OpenMasjidAPPS registry entry).
- Registered in OpenMasjidAPPS `registry.yaml` as:
  ```yaml
  - id: donations
    repo: OpenMasjid-Solutions/OpenMasjidDonations
    ref: v0.1.0
  ```
- Container image published to **GHCR** (match Display's naming convention, e.g. `ghcr.io/openmasjid-solutions/openmasjiddonations:<version>`). Confirm Display's exact image path and mirror it.

---

## 4. Scope

### ✅ In scope (v1.0)
- **Public donation site** (no login): one or more donation pages/appeals, each with title, rich content, images, **preset amounts + a custom amount**, one-time and **monthly recurring** options, optional **cover-the-fees** and **Gift Aid** (UK) toggles, branded with the masjid's name/logo/colours.
- **Card payments via Stripe**, on-brand (Stripe **Payment Element**, embedded), with a clean success/thank-you page and optional emailed receipt.
- **Admin panel** (login-protected): create/edit/reorder/delete donation pages; rich-text + image editor; manage preset amounts; theme options (light/dark, accent, logo, wallpaper); Stripe configuration; **donations log + simple stats** (totals, by appeal, recent, CSV export).
- **Startup configuration:** receive masjid details from the platform profile (see §6); accept Stripe keys + currency (via install settings and/or in the admin).
- **Platform integration:** auto sign-in via OpenMasjidOS SSO (server-to-server) and match the dashboard's light/dark theme + wallpaper, with a **local admin password fallback** for standalone use (mirror Display).
- **One container**, least-privilege, Pi-friendly, with a `/healthz` endpoint.

### ❌ Out of scope (v1.0)
- Storing or processing raw card numbers (Stripe handles all card data).
- Non-Stripe processors (PayPal, etc.) — design cleanly so a second provider *could* be added later, but build Stripe only.
- Full accounting/CRM, donor logins, tax-receipt PDFs beyond a simple email receipt.
- Modifying the OpenMasjidOS platform or the OpenMasjidAPPS contract.

### 🔭 Later (design for, don't build now)
- Additional payment providers; donor accounts; recurring-donation management portal for donors; multi-currency per appeal; webhook-driven recurring receipts when the box is publicly reachable.

---

## 5. Architecture

Mirror Display: everything in **one container** — the API server, the static web build, and the SQLite data store.

```
   Donor's phone / kiosk ─▶  Donation site (React)         Admin (React, same app, /admin)
                                  │  REST (+ Stripe.js Payment Element)        │
                                  ▼                                            ▼
                         OpenMasjidDonations server (Node + TypeScript, Fastify)
                          • REST API: appeals, content, settings, donations
                          • Stripe: create PaymentIntent / Subscription (server-side secret)
                          • Confirm on return via Stripe retrieve (no inbound webhook needed)
                          • Optional Stripe webhook endpoint (when publicly reachable)
                          • Platform SSO + theme (server-to-server) with local-password fallback
                          • SQLite (better-sqlite3) + uploaded images on the data volume
                                  │                         │
                                  ▼ outbound HTTPS          ▼
                            api.stripe.com           /opt/openmasjid/apps/donations/data
```

**Self-hosted reality — this is critical:** a masjid box is usually only reachable on the **LAN**, so **do not depend on inbound Stripe webhooks** for the core flow. Confirm payments by having the server **retrieve** the PaymentIntent/Checkout Session from Stripe (outbound call, always works) when the donor returns, and record the donation then. Treat webhooks as an **optional enhancement** (resilience + recurring `invoice.paid`) that only works when the masjid has exposed the app publicly. The app must work fully for one-time donations with **no public ingress**.

---

## 6. Startup configuration & secrets

### Masjid details (from the platform profile)
Declare the fields the app needs via **`uses_profile`** in `manifest.yaml`. The platform injects them as `MASJID_*` environment variables (see APP_MANIFEST_SPEC §4). Use them to pre-fill the site branding, receipts, and default currency:
- `name → MASJID_NAME`, `address → MASJID_ADDRESS`, `email → MASJID_EMAIL`, `phone → MASJID_PHONE`, `website → MASJID_WEBSITE`, `currency → MASJID_CURRENCY`, `timezone → MASJID_TIMEZONE`, `language → MASJID_LANGUAGE`.

**Be resilient:** if any `MASJID_*` var is absent (the platform's central-profile feature is still being finalised), fall back to values the admin enters in-app. **Never hard-fail because a profile var is missing.** Admin-entered values, once set, take precedence and persist to the data volume.

### Stripe configuration
Stripe keys + currency may arrive two ways; support both, with the data-volume copy as the source of truth:
1. **Install settings** (optional, via `manifest.yaml` `settings`): `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (text), `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (password), `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (password, optional), `CURRENCY` (text/select, default from `MASJID_CURRENCY`).
2. **In the admin panel** — a "Connect Stripe" / payment-settings screen. This keeps install one-click (like Display) and lets the masjid set or rotate keys without reinstalling.

Rules: the **secret key is stored server-side only** (in the SQLite config on the data volume, tight file perms), **never sent to the browser**, **never logged**. Show a clear **"TEST MODE"** badge when a `sk_test_`/`pk_test_` key is in use. The site refuses to show the donate button until a valid publishable+secret pair is configured, with a friendly "Donations aren't set up yet" message for visitors and a clear setup prompt for the admin.

---

## 7. The donation experience (public site)

- **Appeals/pages:** the admin can create several (e.g. *General Fund, Zakat, Building Fund, Ramadan Appeal*). Each has: slug, title, rich body (text + images), hero image, preset amounts, allow-custom toggle, one-time/monthly options, optional goal + progress bar, active/inactive. A configurable default/home appeal.
- **Amounts:** **preset (static) buttons + a custom amount field**, both clearly shown; sensible min/max; currency from config. (This is the core "custom and static amounts" requirement.)
- **Checkout (embedded, on-brand):** use **Stripe Payment Element**. Server creates a **PaymentIntent** (one-time) or a **Subscription** (monthly) with the secret key; client confirms with the publishable key. Keep the donor on the masjid's branded page.
- **Cover-the-fees:** optional toggle so the donor can add the processing fee and the masjid receives the full intended amount. Compute transparently and show the donor the total.
- **Gift Aid (UK, optional per appeal):** if enabled, collect the declaration (UK taxpayer confirmation + name + home address) and store it with the donation for the masjid's records.
- **After paying:** a warm thank-you page; an **optional email receipt** (use Stripe's receipt emails, or send via configured SMTP if present — keep it optional and graceful if no mail is configured). Record the donation locally for the admin log.
- **Trust:** the payment area should feel secure and professional (clear amounts, Stripe's lock/badging, no jarring layout shift). It must be fast on a Raspberry Pi.

---

## 8. The admin panel

Login-protected (platform SSO when embedded; local password fallback). Sections:
- **Appeals** — list, create, edit (rich content + image upload), reorder, activate/deactivate, delete.
- **Appearance** — light/dark/follow-system, accent colour, masjid logo, wallpaper; live preview; matches the dashboard theme when launched from OpenMasjidOS.
- **Payments** — Stripe keys, currency, cover-the-fees default, Gift Aid default, test/live indicator, optional webhook secret + the webhook URL to paste into Stripe (only relevant if publicly exposed).
- **Donations** — a log of received donations (amount, appeal, date, donor name/email if given, one-time/recurring, status), totals and simple stats (this period, by appeal), and **CSV export**.
- **About** — version, links, and the **AGPL "Source code"** link to this repo.

Uploaded images and all settings/records live on the data volume (`/opt/openmasjid/apps/donations/data`). Validate and constrain uploads (type, size).

---

## 9. Stripe integration rules

- Use the official **`stripe`** Node SDK (server) and **`@stripe/stripe-js`** + **`@stripe/react-stripe-js`** (client). Pin versions and a fixed Stripe **API version**.
- **One-time:** create a PaymentIntent server-side (amount in the smallest currency unit, correct currency, metadata: appeal id, gift-aid, cover-fees). Confirm with Payment Element. On return, **retrieve** the PaymentIntent server-side to verify `succeeded` before recording — never trust the client's word.
- **Recurring (monthly):** create a Stripe **Customer + Subscription** (or a Checkout Session in `subscription` mode). Ongoing charge confirmation ideally uses the `invoice.paid` **webhook**, which requires public ingress — so treat ongoing recurring tracking as best-effort and document the dependency. Creating the subscription works fine on a LAN (outbound only).
- **Idempotency:** use idempotency keys on PaymentIntent/Subscription creation to avoid duplicates on ret␣ies.
- **Webhooks (optional):** if `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set, expose `/api/stripe/webhook`, **verify the signature**, and handle `payment_intent.succeeded`, `checkout.session.completed`, `invoice.paid`. If not set, the app relies on the retrieve-on-return flow.
- **Amounts & currency:** always compute in integer minor units server-side; never trust client-sent amounts beyond appeal min/max validation. Default currency from `MASJID_CURRENCY`.
- **Rate-limit** the donation-creation and webhook endpoints. Validate all inputs (zod).

---

## 10. Manifest, compose & registry (follow APP_MANIFEST_SPEC + Display)

**`manifest.yaml`** (root of this repo) — fields per the spec:
```yaml
id: donations
name: OpenMasjid Donations
tagline: Take card donations on your masjid's network with Stripe
category: donations
version: 0.1.0
author: hasan-ismail
license: AGPL-3.0
icon: icon.svg
screenshots:
  - screenshots/1.png
  - screenshots/2.png
uses_profile: [name, address, email, phone, website, currency, timezone, language]
settings:
  - { key: STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, label: Stripe publishable key, type: text,     required: false, description: "Starts with pk_. You can also set this inside the app." }
  - { key: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,      label: Stripe secret key,      type: password, required: false, description: "Starts with sk_. Stored on your device, never shared." }
  - { key: STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET,  label: Stripe webhook secret,  type: password, required: false, description: "Optional. Only needed if you expose donations publicly." }
  - { key: CURRENCY,               label: Currency,               type: text,     required: false, description: "ISO code, e.g. GBP. Defaults to your masjid currency." }
ports:
  - { container: 8080, label: Donations site, default_host: 7870 }
resources:
  memory_hint: 128M
  cpu_hint: 0.25
  storage_hint: 200M
  arch: [amd64, arm64]
```
(Keep install settings optional so install stays one-click; Stripe can be configured in-app.)

**`docker-compose.yml`** — obey the spec's conventions exactly: required labels `com.openmasjid.app: donations`, `com.openmasjid.service: <name>`, `com.openmasjid.managed: "true"`; do **not** set a top-level `name:` (platform uses project `omos-donations`); map the platform-assigned port `"${OMOS_HOST_PORT_8080:-7870}:8080"`; bind the data volume under `/opt/openmasjid/apps/donations/data`; `restart: unless-stopped`; `env_file` the platform `.env`; **no** `privileged`, **no** docker.sock, **no** `network_mode: host`/`pid: host`; `cap_drop: [ALL]`; run as a **non-root** user; `read_only` root fs + `tmpfs` for `/tmp` where possible. The server listens on container port **8080** (non-root friendly). Copy Display's compose as the starting point and adapt.

---

## 11. Tech stack (match Display)

- **TypeScript everywhere.** `strict` on, no `any` without a justifying comment.
- **`server/`** — Node 20+ + **Fastify** REST API (WebSocket only if you actually need live updates; donations probably don't). **better-sqlite3** for storage. **`stripe`** SDK. **argon2** for the fallback admin password. Validate input with **zod**.
- **`web/`** — **React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind**, **shadcn/ui** components, **Motion** for animation, **lucide-react** icons, **@stripe/react-stripe-js** for the Payment Element. One app serving the public site and the `/admin` panel.
- **One container** via a multi-stage **Dockerfile** (build web, build server, final runtime serves the web build + API), exactly like Display. `docker compose up -d` runs it.
- Keep it **lean and Pi-friendly**; lazy-load the admin bundle so the donor page stays light.

---

## 12. Design & theming

Match the OpenMasjid family — the polish must equal Display and the dashboard.
- **Tokens via CSS variables.** Dark is default; light + follow-system supported. Primary **emerald** (`#1FA37A` family), **gold** (`#D4AF37`) accent used sparingly, deep night-green dark base. Never hardcode hex in components.
- **When launched from OpenMasjidOS**, match the dashboard's theme + wallpaper (server-to-server, like Display). Standalone, use the app's own appearance settings.
- Subtle Islamic-geometric texture; respectful, serene, trustworthy — this is a payments page, so clarity and calm beat flashiness.
- **Motion** for gentle entrances, button/press springs, and a satisfying (understated) success state after a donation. **Always honour `prefers-reduced-motion`.**
- **i18n + RTL ready** (English first; logical CSS properties; structure strings for translation). Do not put Quranic/sacred text into decorative chrome.
- Plain, warm, non-technical wording everywhere (donor- and admin-facing). Friendly errors; never a raw stack trace.

---

## 13. Security

- Stripe **secret key server-side only**; never to the client, never logged, never committed. Publishable key is the only key the browser sees.
- **Never handle raw card data** — Stripe Elements only (PCI SAQ-A).
- **Verify Stripe webhook signatures**; verify payment status by server-side **retrieve**, never by trusting client claims.
- Admin behind auth (platform SSO server-to-server, verified with the platform — never trust the browser — with a local argon2 password fallback). Sessions: signed, HTTP-only, SameSite cookies.
- **Rate-limit** donation creation and webhook endpoints; validate/limit uploads; sanitise rich content to prevent stored XSS on the public page.
- Least-privilege container (per §10). Outbound HTTPS to Stripe only; assume no inbound by default.
- Note for admins (in docs): taking donations from outside the masjid network means exposing the app publicly — recommend doing so only behind HTTPS (e.g. the platform's remote-access/tunnel helper).

---

## 14. Coding conventions
- Clarity over cleverness; comment the *why*. Small commits, conventional-commit messages.
- Everything builds and runs via the documented commands and `docker compose up -d`.
- Share types between server and web where practical; validate all external input at the boundary (zod).
- All user-facing strings via i18n; all colours/spacing via tokens.
- Never copy umbrelOS/PolyForm code (see §2).

---

## 15. Build & run (mirror Display)
```bash
# server (API + Stripe + storage)
cd server && npm install && npm run build && npm test

# web (donor site + admin)
cd web && npm install && npm run build

# everything together (Docker; also what the App Store runs)
docker compose up -d
```
For local dev: run the server, run `cd web && npm run dev` (Vite proxies `/api` to the server). Use Stripe **test keys** and Stripe's test cards; optionally `stripe listen` to forward webhooks to localhost while developing the optional webhook path.

---

## 16. CI & versioning
- **`VERSION`** file at the root is the single source of truth; stamp it into the build.
- **Semver, `0.x` = pre-release.** Start at `0.1.0`. Tag releases `vX.Y.Z`.
- **GitHub Actions:** on a `v*` tag, build the multi-arch (amd64 + arm64) image and **push to GHCR** with the version tag (mirror Display's workflow). Then the app is added/updated in OpenMasjidAPPS `registry.yaml` with the new `ref`.

---

## 17. Definition of done (per feature)
Builds via the documented commands and `docker compose up -d`; `tsc`/lint clean; works in light + dark and matches the dashboard theme when embedded; honours `prefers-reduced-motion`; admin behind auth; **Stripe secret never reaches the client**; one-time donations work **with no public ingress**; manifest + compose pass the APP_MANIFEST_SPEC rules; friendly wording; no raw error reaches the user.

---

## 18. Working agreement for Claude (the coding agent)
- **First, read the three repos** (OpenMasjidOS, OpenMasjidAPPS, OpenMasjidDisplay). Treat Display as the template and APP_MANIFEST_SPEC.md as the contract. When this file and Display's real code disagree, follow Display and flag it.
- Build in **vertical slices**, each end-to-end (server + web + theme):
  1. Repo scaffold: `server/` + `web/` + `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` + `manifest.yaml` + `icon.svg` + `LICENSE` (AGPL-3.0) + `VERSION` + CI, copying Display's structure; container boots and serves an empty themed shell + `/healthz`.
  2. **Platform SSO + theme** (server-to-server) with local-password fallback — port Display's mechanism.
  3. Admin **Payments** screen + Stripe config (env + in-app), test-mode badge, "not set up yet" states.
  4. **Appeals** model + admin CRUD with rich content + image upload (SQLite + data volume).
  5. **Public donation page**: preset + custom amounts, Payment Element, **one-time** PaymentIntent, retrieve-on-return confirmation, thank-you page, donation recorded.
  6. Cover-the-fees + Gift Aid; optional email receipt.
  7. **Recurring (monthly)** subscriptions (+ optional webhook path).
  8. Donations log + stats + CSV export.
  9. Appearance/theming polish, animations, empty/edge states, friendly errors.
  10. README.md (user-facing, in Display's style), screenshots, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md; tag `v0.1.0`; add the `registry.yaml` entry to OpenMasjidAPPS.
- **Never** put the Stripe secret in the client or logs. **Never** assume inbound webhooks for the core flow. Ask before adding heavy dependencies or deviating from the contract.
